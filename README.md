## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values in `DiscountOffer`, ''DiscountPrice' and 'Reviews' by filling with `0` (no discount).

2. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Histograms for `price` distribution.
   * Boxplot shows outliers in high price range.
   * Barplot for Top 10 Categories
   * Countplot for Distribution by gender
    
3. **Bivariate Analysis**

   * Scatterplots: `Price vs Rating`.
   * Boxplots: `Category vs Price` (top 10 categories).

4. **Multivariate Analysis**

   * Pairplot for `price`, `discount`, and `rating`.
   * Heatmap for correlation analysis.
